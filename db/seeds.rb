# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
Book.create!([
  {title: "I love CSCE431!"}
  {title: "I love the workload!"}
  {title: "I love the partipation quizzes!"}
  {title: "I love the lab work!"}
  {title: "I love CSCE431!"}
